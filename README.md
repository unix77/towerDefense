# towerDefense

This is a project encouraged by the Programming Technology class at UNS - Bah√≠a Blanca.

It is a basic tower defense game meant to help us learn design patterns and to apply them in real-world problems.

We are given a set of assignments every two weeks. We have to do them to the best of our ability given what we have learned in class.
